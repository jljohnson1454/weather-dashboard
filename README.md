# Weather Dashboard

## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment was to create a weather dashboard utlizing APIs to retrieve forecast information for both the current day and a five day period. With fetch requests, I converted the data to imperial units so we use farenheit for the temperatures and wind speed as miles per hour. For the UV Index, I included color coding for mild to severe ratings.
